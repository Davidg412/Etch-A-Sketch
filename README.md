# Etch-A-Sketch
This project for me was really about bringing HTML, CSS, and JS together
to create an interactive web page. I realize the importance of knowing
all 3 of these languages and how powerful they can be when you bring them
together.

The major take away for this project is that Javascript is truly what
will make your webpage dynamic. It is pretty simple to create a static
webpage without interaction or variables, but we all know that in the real
world a webpage for a business requires much interaction.
