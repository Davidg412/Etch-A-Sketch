# Etch-A-Sketch
This project for me was really about bringing HTML, CSS, and JS together
to create an interactive web page. I realize the importance of knowing
all 3 of these languages and how powerful they can be when you bring them all
together.

The major take away from this project is that Javascript is truly what
makes your web page dynamic. It is pretty simple to create a static
webpage without interaction or variables using HTML & CSS, but we all know
that in the real world a webpage requires much interaction.
